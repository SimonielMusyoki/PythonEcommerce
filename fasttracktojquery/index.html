                Step 2: Fill out the required information, including your email address and
                phone number<br />
                Step 3: You will then receive a 4-digit verification code by SMS to verify your
                account. If you haven't received it after 1 attempt, you can request the code
                via SMS again, email or phone call.<br />
                Step 4: You can then compute the code on the Jumia log in platform<br />
                Step 5 : You can then configure your personalized PIN code, or set up your
                fingerprint to secure your account.
                <br />
                Step 6 : Your account is now created!<br />
                Step 7: Select your delivery address on the map and proceed with your order
